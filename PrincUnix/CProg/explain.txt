file2.h:2:6: error: redefinition of ‘a’
 char a = 2;
      ^
In file included from main.c:1:0:
file1.h:2:6: note: previous definition of ‘a’ was here
 char a = 1;
      ^
-----------------------
EXPLANATION OF ABOVE:
Since file1.h and file2.h are being compiled together,
it should be ensured that no variables share names with other variables
present in their same scope.
Here, two declarations use the same name, so it throws an error.

In file included from main.c:2:0:
file2.h:3:15: error: conflicting types for ‘b’
 extern double b;
               ^
In file included from main.c:1:0:
file1.h:3:5: note: previous definition of ‘b’ was here
 int b = 1;
-----------------------
EXPLANATION OF ABOVE:
This is not a simple redefinition.
The extern keyword changes the linkage to make an external variable available.
The external variable presumably exists in another C file or header file.
The issue is that it is trying to make an external DOUBLE named b available,
whereas b has already been defined as an INT (NOT A DOUBLE) in file1.h
